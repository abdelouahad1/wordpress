            giveaways or creating engaging writing contests. Just like book tags, people love being nominated for awards
            too.Sometimes authors, publishers, and other bloggers will approach you for a guest post. While TUL doesn’t
            currently allow full guest posts for personal reasons, I do allow writers to contribute to book posts. I
            love having diverse voices and opinions on my blog ublishers will send you top secret and coveted book
            covers to circulate on a specific date. Typically, you reveal the cover and build hype for the book. I
            personally don’t do these, but maybe if you had wine on the cover…or my cat.Book bloggers love book tags and
            circulate them on Twitter like a librarian handing out library cards at a school open house. These book tags
            are fun and a great way to attract new bloggers to your site. They help build community and backlink
            bloggers too.
            P.S. You can make your own and circulate it. Should I start an Uncorked tag?
